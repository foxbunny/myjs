# MyJS

Experimental library for the JavaScript purist

## Overview

This library is a very very thin wrapper around raw DOM method. It focuses on
newer browsers and (to an extent) perfromance. It also serves as a playgorund
for a long-time jQuery junky, so don't expect the functions to be correct or,
indeed, without bugs.

It's in very early stages of development. You've been warned.
